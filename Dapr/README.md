# Container App sample applications and ARM templates - Dapr
We have a few sample applications and ARM templates that you can try out for Dapr scenarios in Container Apps. The applications have been containerized and published to a public Docker repository. So you can deploy the ARM templates as-is, or download this GitHub repository and modify the applications and ARM templates to suit other testing purposes.

A Dapr bindings example will be uploaded soon.
